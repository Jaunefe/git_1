Add a directory for test that will be ignored by git.


    1.- Create a directory where the test files live and it will be ignored by 
    git (remember git will ignore empty directories, so write at lest one file)
    
    2.- Write in the root directory of the project a file named ".gitignore"
    
    3.- Edit that file adding the name of the directories that will be ignored
    
    4.-Git detects the changes thru the status command if some changes have 
    occurred in the ignored directories. You will see in the console that 
    something changes in the .gitignore file you can commit this changes that 
    will havenÂ´t any effect on the ignored files, but has been reported
